Jupyter notebook are great for research & data exploration. They are not for
developing Python code (there's also console & QT)

- Code cell
- In/Out
- magic %pwd, %timeit
- out = !ls $log_dir
- markdown
    - header
    - list
    - url
    - math
- kernel, restart
- organize by moving cells and the restart
- export to python, html
- nbconvert --execute

Mention [nbdime](https://nbdime.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and other in
ecosystem.
